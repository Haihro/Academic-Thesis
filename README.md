In order to predict the students' future performance, the researchers used five machine learning models, namely “Decision Tree Classifier”, “Gaussian Naïve Bayes”, “K-Nearest Neighbors”, “Logistic Regression” and “Random Forest Classifier”. Among the five models, Logistic Regression was found to be the most accurate. The model is then improved by tuning the hyperparameters and got a mean accuracy score of 68.10%. This final model is then evaluated on the test set to get a final accuracy score of 64%
